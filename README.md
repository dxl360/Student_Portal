# Student_Portal

To run our application, you need to have Android studio. Set up an Android emulator (with Android 6.0 or above) and just hit run.

After launching the application, you will need to create an account with a valid email and password.

Valid passwords have to be 8 to 20 characters and include at least one uppercase and lowercase letter as well as one number.

If the page your are accessing is within the sliding menu, in order to go back to the previous page, you must use the sliding menu to go to the previous page (ex create new event to manage page). Hitting the back button in those instances will take you back to the login page.

What does work:
QR code generation (see profile page)
Add event/item, reject user (if event/item creator)
Google maps for directions in eventDetail

What doesn't work:
Event detail page: add to calendar does not work. Something to do with getting permissions on the device.

If you want to test the application using an account that has everything already, log into the following account.

For the Exchange, test has created two items (minifridge and STATS Textbook), watchlisted one (STATS Textbook) and reserved one item (wierd stuff).
