# Student_Portal

To run our application, you need to have Android studio. Set up an Android emulator (with Android 6.0 or above) and just hit run.

After launching the application, you will need to create an account with a valid email and password.

Valid passwords have to be 8 to 20 characters and include at least one uppercase and lowercase letter as well as one number.

If the page your are accessing is within the sliding menu, in order to go back to the previous page, you must use the sliding menu to go to the previous page (ex create new event to manage page). Hitting the back button in those instances will take you back to the login page.

To test our application, we used 
username: abc123@case.edu
password:

Also you need at least two accounts to test the differnt pages that will show up for a buyer or seller (itemDetailActivity) as well as the creator of the event and an event particpant (eventDetailActivity)
